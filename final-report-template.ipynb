    "Our project involves analyzing 3.5 million consumer complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from 2011 to 2023. We'll use Natural language Processing to analyze how the wording of complaints affects a company's response. Our goal is to provide insights on complaint language and its impact, helping companies improve their responses and enhancing the outcomes for consumers and businesses.\n",
