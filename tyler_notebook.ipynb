Also, I, the federally protected consumer, never gave them permission to have my personal information, that is a violation of my right to privacy pursuant to 15 USC 1692a. Furthermore, Ability Recovery Services just admitted to participating in conspiring against my rights with their client, pursuant to 18 USC 241, which they shall be fined and imprisoned for 10 years. They are violating 18 USC 1028, by unlawfully transferring my authentication feature ( social security number ) electronically. This debt collector is violating a number of my FEDERALLY PROTECTED CONSUMER RIGHTS ; some, but not all, are included in my Bill of Particulars. Delete this alleged debt from all of my consumer reports immediately and terminate all further collection efforts.   \n",

The only way to cancel is to call, but when I call their 1-800 number ( as listed on the website ), they say \" Please try again later. '' They are continuing to charge me each month and there is no way to cancel. \\n\\nFinally, I was able to reach them by phone, but I had to choose the 'french ' option. Luckily the french-speaking agent also spoke english and we were able to cancel. \\n\\nBy then, I had already paid an extra month. \\n\\nIF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC READING THIS : Avoid transunion at all costs. If you HAVE to subscribe, use a burner/one-time credit card.   \n",

Furthermore the company even tried changing it's name as I noticed between XX/XX/XXXX andXX/XX/XXXX, the creditor name on this account was changed from XXXX to XXXX  on my Credit Report.

       "674320   I applied to refinance an existing mortgage with Bank of America. I responded to questions from the Primary Originator explaining what I desired to accomplish in the way of terms for the refinance, including the fact I do not escrow property taxes or insurance. I was told starting the refinance required payment of a credit report fee of {$28.00} which was nonrefundable and an appraisal fee of {$860.00} which was refundable any time prior to the occurrence of the appraisal. I submitted all requested documentation. During the process I received 3-4 Closing Disclosures which began to create concern as well as recurring requests for additional information which became burdensome. At a point prior to the appraisal I suggested the process stop and the {$860.00} appraisal expense I paid be refunded at which time I was told it was too late to receive a refund. I acquiesced continuing to provide the information / documentation requested and allowing the property appraisal to occur. Approximately 1 week prior to closing I was informed Bank of America intended to collect {$10000.00} to escrow property tax. I explained this was unacceptable and I had stated early in the process I do not escrow taxes. The response was that Bank of America requires the escrow of the taxes. A few days prior to the closing date I received two Closing Disclosures both dated the same day and were virtually identical other than section F. Prepaids and the section Calculating Cash to Close ; result being one Closing Disclosure stated {$1600.00} To Borrower and the other Closing Disclosure stated {$8300.00} From Borrower. A telephone discussion with the Primary Originator one day prior to scheduled closing resulted in my being told I would have to pay the {$8300.00} at closing. At that point I requested cancelling the refinance. Bank of America personnel were misleading, dishonest, and perhaps operating fraudulently and the process as a whole was confusing.   \n",

The only way to cancel is to call but when I call their - number ( as listed on the website ) they say \" Please try again later.  They are continuing to charge me each month and there is no way to cancel. \\n\\nFinally I was able to reach them by phone but I had to choose the french  option. Luckily the french-speaking agent also spoke english and we were able to cancel. \\n\\nBy then I had already paid an extra month. \\n\\nIF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC READING THIS : Avoid transunion at all costs. If you HAVE to subscribe use a burner/one-time credit card.   \n",

       "674320   I applied to refinance an existing mortgage with Bank of America. I responded to questions from the Primary Originator explaining what I desired to accomplish in the way of terms for the refinance including the fact I do not escrow property taxes or insurance. I was told starting the refinance required payment of a credit report fee of $. which was nonrefundable and an appraisal fee of $. which was refundable any time prior to the occurrence of the appraisal. I submitted all requested documentation. During the process I received - Closing Disclosures which began to create concern as well as recurring requests for additional information which became burdensome. At a point prior to the appraisal I suggested the process stop and the $. appraisal expense I paid be refunded at which time I was told it was too late to receive a refund. I acquiesced continuing to provide the information / documentation requested and allowing the property appraisal to occur. Approximately  week prior to closing I was informed Bank of America intended to collect $. to escrow property tax. I explained this was unacceptable and I had stated early in the process I do not escrow taxes. The response was that Bank of America requires the escrow of the taxes. A few days prior to the closing date I received two Closing Disclosures both dated the same day and were virtually identical other than section F. Prepaids and the section Calculating Cash to Close ; result being one Closing Disclosure stated $. To Borrower and the other Closing Disclosure stated $. From Borrower. A telephone discussion with the Primary Originator one day prior to scheduled closing resulted in my being told I would have to pay the $. at closing. At that point I requested cancelling the refinance. Bank of America personnel were misleading dishonest and perhaps operating fraudulently and the process as a whole was confusing.   \n",

These complaints were submitted in  of  while in the middle of my court battle with the Debt Buyer. Wells Fargo really did a number scamming me out of my vehicle AND I was a service member. I just hope that in the limelight of the recent scandal and settlement that those that have been affected so much are truly compensated. Not to mention that during all of this I was completely unaware of the fact that when I financed the van through Wells Fargo in  that they put my interest rate @  % which they should nt have went over  %. I was a service member at this time and should not have had to go through what they put me through or my wife. I finally gave up in court and settled with the Debt Buyer. I feel that Wells Fargo should compensate me for all the money and distress I went through as a result of their negligence. I have  of court paperwork. They need to be aware of how much pain can be caused because debt buyers and big banks decide they are going to use shady tactics against everyone.'"
